How It Works

Users sign up and create an account. Users log in, receiving a JWT token for authentication. They can check their balance, deposit, or withdraw funds securely. All transactions are stored in MongoDB, ensuring data integrity and security.

Next Steps

Add UI enhancements with Material-UI or Tailwind CSS. Implement transaction history tracking. Improve security with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
